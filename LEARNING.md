### What did I learn here?

1. With psql, always add semicolon at the end of a SQL command.
2. It's good to .strip() environment variables, especially I we export them en masse.
3. Containers in different directories cannot communicate without a network that acts as a bridge.
4. psycopg package to insert data into postgres
